# Abstract

In recent years, riding e-scooters as a hobby has evolved into one of the popular forms of transportation in our city traffic. As it is becoming increasingly popular, micromobility-related accidents have also increased. To reduce such casualties, this thesis proposes a novel methodology to differentiate between e-scooter riders and pedestrians in urban environments. The Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) team that plans out safety features for city traffic will be able to utilize this algorithm to collect data on e-scooter user's frequency in general traffic. This data will allow city planners to plan out special road strips in places that have registered high e-scooter usage, thus enabling safer commutes for e-scooter riders. Although research on Vulnerable Road Users has increased in the past years, there has been very little research done to ensure the safety of e-scooter users. This work is among the first few to present a perception solution that works on point cloud data. The novelty lies in harnessing “Elasticity” and “Spatial” data from the actors and using them as features to train ensemble learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and XG Boost. Both the terms “Elasticity” and “Spatial” are well explained in the methodology chapter of the thesis. All the tests were conducted in a private dataset recorded during the peak rush hours on the college campus.
